WordlistEditor
==============

JavaScript program for interactive viewing, manipulating, and editing of wordlists, represented in form of TSV files.

Problems
========

- Updating should NOT have wordlist re-appear if we are dealing in cognate mode.
- Check for cognate ids and select any other id if that is not given, create a cognate id based on glosses if none is available in the data.
- update after each operation
- send data to the server after each operation
- send signal that data has been submitted right after the submit button in alignment mode has been pressed
- add "previous and next" button in addition to "select concepts"
